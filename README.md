## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm based on machine learning. The algorithm is developed using the Go programming language. Currently, the algorithm's performance is suboptimal and requires optimization. Additionally, the project includes a user interface (UI) component, which is an open-source code obtained from the internet and implemented using PyQt.

## Algorithm
The algorithm is based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach, which utilizes random simulations and evaluations of game state spaces to predict the best next move.

## Programming Language and Optimization Approach
The project is implemented using the Go programming language. The current algorithm's performance is suboptimal and requires optimization. One of the suggested approaches to improve performance is leveraging Go's multi-threading capabilities to parallelize computations.

## UI
The UI component is implemented using PyQt, a Python binding for creating graphical user interfaces for desktop applications.
